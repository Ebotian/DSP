# Sweeping Robot Plan

## PART 1: Homework Completion

The first part of the plan involves completing the homework assignment. The steps are as follows:

1. **Modify the Code**: Adjust the existing code to meet the requirements of the homework assignment.
2. **Record Videos**: Capture videos demonstrating the results of the modified code.
3. **Report Writing**: Write a comprehensive report detailing the changes made to the code, how it works, and the results obtained.
4. **Homework Submission**: Submit the completed homework assignment as per the submission guidelines.

## PART 2: Road Test Design and Execution

The second part of the plan involves designing and executing a road test for the sweeping robot.

### Designing the Road Test

The road test will involve testing various inputs and outputs of the robot:

- **Inputs**:

  - Camera: To capture real-time video feed.
  - Infrared Light: For night vision or low light conditions.
  - PC & Phone Signal: For remote control and monitoring.
  - Microphone: To capture audio (not yet implemented).
  - Button: For manual control.

- **Outputs**:
  - Wheel: To control movement.
  - Sound: For audible alerts and communication.
  - Light: For visual signals and illumination.
  - Servo Angle: To control direction.
  - Remote Signal: For remote operation.

### Executing the Road Test

1. **On-Road Testing**: Conduct extensive on-road testing to evaluate performance under real-world conditions.
2. **Prepare Presentation**: Compile the results of the road test into a PowerPoint presentation for review and discussion.

This plan ensures a systematic approach to completing the homework assignment and testing the sweeping robot's performance on-road.
